- ✅ API returns all data correctly

## 📝 Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Now (Recommended)
I'll continue building all the dashboard pages and components. This will take another 2-3 hours but you'll have a complete working dashboard.

### Option 2: Pause and Test
You can test the API now:
```bash
cd zain-pos-api
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3001/health` to verify it's running.

### Option 3: Resume Tomorrow
We can continue building the dashboard pages tomorrow when you have more time.

- 📱 Works perfectly on mobile devices
